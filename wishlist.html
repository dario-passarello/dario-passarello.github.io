        This is my personal wishlist

    My wishes (in random order):
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li> Transport Fever 2 (on Steam) (I have already the first), I will play it like 400 hours probably :) - At full price (40$) is definitely not worth it, maybe it's better to wait for a deal
    <!--<li> Some munchkin expansions (I have already 1,2,3,5-6-7). The next in my list is 4-->
    <li> Carcassonne
     <li> <b>A new mouse</b>, the old one is broken (I prefer it wired) 
    <!--<li> A new keyboard (I prefer it wired, non mechanical, for noise reasons :( )-->
    <li> A stand for my Dell G5 Laptop or...
    <li> ...everything that could help me maintain a correct position and other good habits while studying/working (Stay upright, drink some water...)
    <li> A book about computer stuff or science that you liked and you think that I should read it 
    </ul>
